1. Data Preprocessing
   - The code imports necessary libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, and NLTK for text preprocessing.
   - A CSV file named multiple dataset _Copy.csv is read into a pandas DataFrame (df).
   - The DataFrame is shuffled randomly to avoid ordering bias using the `sample` method.
   - The postId column is dropped from the DataFrame as it is not needed for analysis.
   - The shape of the DataFrame is checked using the `shape` attribute.
   - The occurrences of each unique value in the 'topic' column are counted using `value_counts()`.

2. Text Preprocessing
   - NLTK's Arabic stop words list is imported.
   - A function `clean_text()` is defined to preprocess the text data
     - Convert all words to lowercase and remove punctuation.
     - Tokenize the text into individual words.
     - Lemmatize each word and remove stop words.
   - The function is applied to the 'comment' column to create a new 'cleaned_comments' column.

3. Bag-of-Words Representation
   - The CountVectorizer from sklearn is imported.
   - The 'cleaned_comments' column is transformed into a Bag-of-Words (BoW) representation using CountVectorizer.
   - The BoW representation is converted into a dense array and stored in the DataFrame 'data'.

4. N-gram Representation
   - Another CountVectorizer is imported with n-gram range set to (1,2) to capture both single words and pairs of consecutive words.
   - The 'cleaned_comments' column is transformed into an n-gram representation using the new CountVectorizer.
   - The n-gram representation is stored in the DataFrame 'feature_ngram'.

5. TF-IDF Representation
   - The TfidfVectorizer from sklearn is imported.
   - The 'cleaned_comments' column is transformed into a TF-IDF representation using TfidfVectorizer.
   - The TF-IDF representation is stored in the DataFrame 'feature_tfidf'.

6. Data Preparation for Classification
   - The target variable 'y' is extracted from the DataFrame as the 'topic' column.
   - The feature matrix 'x' is set as the TF-IDF representation stored in 'feature_tfidf'.
   - The feature matrix 'x' is standardized using StandardScaler from sklearn.

7. Model Training and Evaluation
   - The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split from sklearn.
   - A Logistic Regression model with multinomial classification and lbfgs solver is created using LogisticRegression.
   - The model is trained on the training data using `fit()`.
   - Predictions are made on the test data using the trained model.
   - The confusion matrix is calculated and displayed as a heatmap using ConfusionMatrixDisplay from sklearn.
   - The accuracy of the model on the test data is calculated using `accuracy_score`.
   - A classification report with precision, recall, F1-score, and support is generated and printed using `classification_report`.

The code demonstrates text preprocessing, feature extraction using BoW, n-grams, and TF-IDF, and the training and evaluation of a Logistic Regression model for multiclass classification.
